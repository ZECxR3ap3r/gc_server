- Create a Server on Plutonium https://plutonium.pw/de/docs/server/iw5/setting-up-a-server/

- After you setup your server, go into the server config and change the fs_game dvar to the corresponding mod you want to host for this tutorial were using tpjugg, if you dont want to use a mod leave it blank & remove all the custom stuff in the GSCs

the mod path will always go to the mods folder in %localAppData%\Plutonium\storage\iw5\mods so if you want to host infected change the fs_game dvar to "mods/gc_infected"

- go into _init.gsc and change the port so if you want to use tpjugg simply change the 22222 to your server port
